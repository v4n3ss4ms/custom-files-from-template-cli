# CLI - component creation from template

This repository contains two implementations of a CLI tool designed to create components from predefined templates.
You could choose one of them depending on your preferred environment:

    Python: /python
    Node.js: /node

Each folder contains a dedicated README file with detailed instructions on how to install dependencies, set up the environment, and run the CLI tool.
